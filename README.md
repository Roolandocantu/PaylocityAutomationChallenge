# PaylocityAutomationChallenge
Challenge for Automation QA position
two files were created showing how the bug report should looks like, as I cannot use management tool like Jira, I created a .md file for UI bugs and API bugs to show how I report bugs.
- ![ApiBugReport](./evidences/Bug_Report_api.md)
- ![UIBugReport](./evidences/Bug_Report_ui.md)
